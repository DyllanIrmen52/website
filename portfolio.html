<h3>My project uses commands to put toppings onto the pizza. When the simulator starts, it will ask you what toppings you want. Once you answer, it will cook it in front of you while you watch.</h3>
      <h3>When spreading the paste, it spins in a circular manner. When cutting the pizza, the pizza cutter moves in a diagonal line.</h3>

	    <h3>My project is about using the arrow keys to move the basket left and right. We set up a scoreboard and you can see it during and after the game. The balls are turtles that fall randomly, iteration was used to determine whether the balls were caught by the Basket or if they fell.</h3>

       	<h3>In Scracth we remixed a game but made quite a bit of adjustments. We changed the character, he went from a normal yellow character to a red monster with green eyes and a green mouth. We also changed the level layout to be harder and longer. We used lots of </h3>

            <h3>The 2.1.6 project was given to us to test our new understanding of data protection. We were tasked with diagnosing a data breach in a fish tank monitoring software, it was a result of a phishing email. This made us use the debugger to find the exact area where the damage of the data breach was. After finding the damage to the program, we used our understanding of the functionality of the code to repair it.</h3>
    <h1>4.1.4 Projet</h1>
	    <img src="images/4.1.4 project.PNG" height="400" alt="centered image" class="aligncenter">
    <h3>In 4.1.4 we had to analyze a simulation. We started by running the simulation and playing with the variables to determine their function/effect on the code to answer these 9 questions: How the model works, how the turtles are represented, how the patches are represented, how randomness is used, what exclusions the model has, what questions we had about the model, what suggestions we had for the model, what conclusions we had, and how we can apply it to the real world.</h3>
